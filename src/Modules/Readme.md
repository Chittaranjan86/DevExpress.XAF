# About

This namespace `DevExpress.XAF.Modules` is used for projects that contain XAF modules. You have to install the packages from nuget `Install-Package ModuleName` and then register the module as per XAF docs see [Ways to Register a Module](https://documentation.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/118047/Concepts/Application-Solution-Components/Ways-to-Register-a-Module). For some simple modules distributing them as part of a XAF module may sound overkill, though allows each part of the module author/consume to work transparently, avoid breaking changes etc.
